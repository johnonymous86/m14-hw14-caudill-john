          <p><strong>John built this website!</strong> I am John. I was born and raised near Mosquito Lagoon on Florida’s east coast. I have studied history, English, writing, and environmental law at Stetson University and the University of South Florida. Currently, I am pursing an MA in Web Design and Online Communication through the University of Florida. My short stories have been published in print and online and I am a member of the International Association of Professional Writers and Editors.</p>
          <p>Currently, John spends his spare time writing, doing photography and hiking. He also designs and maintains this very website!</p>

          <p>I have a great interest in science and technology. In my spare time, I enjoy reading about geology, botany, and evolution. I spend as much of my spare time outside as possible so I love to be able to identify the plants and earth formations that I see. </p>
          <p>In addition, I am interested in music, both from a listeners prospective and a player's perspective. I like learning about how other musicians partake in the creative process and I am invigorated by watching musicians perform live.</p>
          <p>I started writing fiction when I was a teenager and the interest has followed me my entire life, leading to an interest in blogging and, eventually, building my own website. Without writing, I would have never attempted to learn the art of webdesign, so I see the two as intrinsically linked.</p>

            <p><strong>I am pursuing Web Design for professional reasons.</strong>In 2023, I accepted a position as webmaster at Wytheville Community College. My experience with web design was limited to working with a CMS like Wordpress so it was eyeopening to learn about Linux and Apache and PHP, things I only had a very cursory understanding of previously.</p> 
            <p>I realized there was a huge volume of knowledge that I was lacking and that the only way I could be truly effectual in my job was to learn as much as I could.</p>
            <p>Beyond my current position, I know the skills I am learning now will translate into other careers in IT and Public Relations. I feel that my creative background in writing, combined with technical skill in web design will serve me professionally for my entire career.</p>
